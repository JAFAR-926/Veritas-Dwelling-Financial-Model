# Veritas-Dwelling-Financial-Model
Veritas Dwellings is a warehouse leasing company with a presence in 32 countries. The core business is the leasing of warehouse space to large corporations. The Company also earns auxiliary revenue from renting the grounds in the weekends for private events.
This project is a fully integrated three-statement financial model built for Veritas Dwellings, a global warehouse leasing company operating in 32 countries. The company’s primary business involves leasing warehouse space to large corporations, with additional auxiliary revenue generated from weekend ground rentals for private and commercial events.

The model evaluates financial performance, capital structure, cash flow generation, and expansion sustainability within a multinational real estate leasing framework.

Forecasting Approach

The model was developed using historical financial data to identify key operational and financial drivers. Historical trends in revenue growth, occupancy rates, operating margins, and capital expenditure intensity were analyzed to build forward-looking assumptions.

All forecasts are assumption-driven and dynamically linked across financial statements.

Revenue Modeling
Core Leasing Revenue

Forecasted using occupancy rate assumptions
Average lease rate growth applied
Expansion across countries incorporated
Auxiliary Event Revenue
Modeled separately from core leasing
Based on weekend utilization rates

Pricing and seasonal assumptions applied

Cost Structure

Operating costs include property maintenance, utilities, security, and administrative expenses. Costs are modeled as a combination of fixed infrastructure costs and variable occupancy-related expenses to reflect operating leverage.

Working Capital

Working capital components were projected using turnover ratios:

Accounts Receivable based on lease collection cycles

Accounts Payable

Accrued expenses

Changes in working capital flow directly into the cash flow statement.

Capital Expenditure and Depreciation

CAPEX is forecasted for warehouse expansion, upgrades, and maintenance. A fixed asset roll-forward schedule tracks asset growth and accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is linked to both the income statement and balance sheet.

Debt and Equity

The model includes a structured debt schedule covering:

Opening balances

New borrowings

Principal repayments

Interest expense calculation

Equity reflects retained earnings and financing assumptions. Key leverage ratios are dynamically calculated.

Financial Statements

The model integrates:

Income Statement

Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method)

Balance Sheet

All statements are fully linked and balanced, ensuring consistency and real-time scenario analysis.

Key Capabilities

Three-statement financial modeling

Revenue segmentation

Working capital forecasting

Debt and interest modeling

Capital-intensive business analysis

Scenario and sensitivity testing
